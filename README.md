# AUDIO-PROCESSING-USING-PYTHON
Audio Processing Project using Python, Anaconda, and Jupyter Notebook

Audio signals are signals that vibrate in the audible frequency range. When someone talks, it generates air pressure signals; the ear takes in these air pressure differences and communicates with the brain. That's how the brain helps a person recognize that the signal is speech and understand what someone is saying.

Anaconda is an open-source distribution for python and R that we used. It is used for data science, machine learning, deep learning, etc. Anaconda offers the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning on a single machine. We also used Jupyter Notebook that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. The Jupyter Notebook App can be executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access (as described in this document) or can be installed on a remote server and accessed through the internet.

We used both Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook to also help us built a Graphical User Interface for this Project, all the documents and codes related to this project are attached.

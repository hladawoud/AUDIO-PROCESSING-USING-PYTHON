# AUDIO-PROCESSING-USING-PYTHON
Audio Processing Project using Python, Anaconda, and Jupyter Notebook

Audio signals are signals that vibrate in the audible frequency range. When someone talks, it generates air pressure signals; the ear takes in these air pressure differences and communicates with the brain. That's how the brain helps a person recognize that the signal is speech and understand what someone is saying.

Anaconda is an open-source distribution for python and R that we used. It is used for data science, machine learning, deep learning, etc. Anaconda offers the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning on a single machine. We also used Jupyter Notebook that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. The Jupyter Notebook App can be executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access (as described in this document) or can be installed on a remote server and accessed through the internet.

We decided on using Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook since they make it easier to use multiple Python Libraries we found hard to use and install in the Command Prompt.

The main Library used in this Project to process audio is Librosa Library. https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html

We used both Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook to also help us built a Graphical User Interface for this Project, all the documents and codes related to this project are attached.
